Project Title: 
Analyzing Western Cape Informal Settlements Expansion (2018-2024) Dataset: Dataset.csv 

Project Overview:
This data analysis project is to analyse how informal settlements and population have expanded over the years in the Western Cape Province from 2018 to 2024. 

Pandas:
I imported pandas because of the dataset i was handling from the Kaggel was on a spreadsheet. 

Numpy:
I imported Numpy because the dataset included numerical figures for the population size over the years in each of these informal settlements.

Matplotlib:
I imported Matplotlib for visualization of the data charts. 

Objective: 
Apply Python libraries (NumPy, pandas) to analyze the dataset, perform data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Findings: 
The findings highlight the growth in population, location-wise distribution, and year-wise trends.

Conclusion: 
This analysis provides insights into the expansion of informal settlements in Capetown from 2018 to 2024.  

Recommendations: 
1.⁠ ⁠Further analysis on factors influencing population growth. 
2.⁠ ⁠Exploration of relationships between population and area. 3.⁠ ⁠Investigation of socioeconomic implications.
